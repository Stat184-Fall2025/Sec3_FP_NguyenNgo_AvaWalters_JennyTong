# Influences on the Global Happiness Index

We are looking to analyze the gross happiness of certain countries for the year of 2024. The information displayed will show a few different factors going into the country's happiness index but the big things to observe are the rank (how the country compares to others) and their life evaluation.

## Overview

When reviewing the global happiness index, we are given data on lots of different countries over the course of many recent years. We have decided to focus our energy on the year of 2024. We believed that focusing on years that occurred further in the past wouldn't help us gage true insight (due to COVID and its repercussions). The dataset has a few different variables present but the main one to focus on is rank. Rank explains how the country's overall happiness compares to other countries. This is a very important term in economics! We are interested in looking at how small changes in overall life evaluation, GDP, and corruption cause a country to rise and fall in the ranks. This can show us simple things such as where individuals would want to go on vacation, all the way to the bold decision to move your whole life to a new country. This kind of data analysis also helps shine a spotlight on the additional correlations between successful countries and where they fall in the Global Happiness Index ranks.

## Interesting Insight

It is interesting to note that the countries that have the highest economic output and rank highest on overall quality of life scales, also rank highest (usually in the top 10) on the Global Happiness Index. These are typically Scandinavian such as Denmark, Sweden, Finland, etc. This shows a link between being financially well off (with strong and stable governments) and having higher happiness levels.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

We are using the publicly available World Happiness Report dataset (2011-2024) on World Happiness Report. The link is: https://www.worldhappiness.report/data-sharing/

## Current Plan

We plan to wrangle the data to show all variables in separate columns for only the year of 2024. This also means that every country will have their own row and will be easier to analyze. We also plan to create tables and accompanying graphs that exhibit the relationship between life evaluation, corruption, and GDP with rank (all separately). Above that, a summary statistics table will be provided to provide the overall details of what we are analyzing. We expect to be able to note the correlation between these variables, which countries are better off, and also how sensitive the rank system is. This means that we will be able to observe how much a country can rise or fall due to only a tenth or hundredth change in life evaluation, corruption, or GDP. All information will be in separate documents and then compiled into a formal pdf where all findings can be observed in a clean and systematic way (this should optimize knowledge intake from the data findings)

## Repo Structure

In our repo, you will be able to find the original World Happiness Report data, our new wrangled data within the QMD file, plan document, and our final write up documents all on the home page (QMD and PDF file). To view any of these documents, simply click on the document name or title and you will be redirected. All infomration necessary to get a full picture of this statistical analysis should be at your disposal here.
